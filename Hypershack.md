Hypershack
==========


Hypershack is a standalone, private space to tinker and learn with 4d objects. It is basically just a static website with no consept of saving or  sharing your objects. If you want to save and share your objects - and see objects built by oter people, have a look at hypersprawl. Anyway, it is recommended to first create your objects in hypershack before uploading them to hypersprawl.  

From this page you can access the latest version of hypershack as well as all previous versions and see the changelog.
