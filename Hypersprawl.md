Hypersprawl
===========

Hypersprawl is a four dimensional space where you can reserve your own block of 4d space to build four dimensional objects for others to see and move around. As of now, Hypersprawl is public and anyone can see anything uploaded in there - assuming it can be found, as 4d space is _large_. In the future some privacy management options may be added.   

You can access hypersprawl here ()[https://www.t.t]. Before venturing into Hypersprawl, you might want to gwt familiar with our Hypershack tutorials regarding how to move around in 4d space.

Hypersprawl Layout and Addresses
--------------------------------

The location of a hypersprawl block needs to be defined in 4 axis, x, y, z and w. Each block is a standard size tesseract, so the location of a block can be represetned by four signed integers, each representing how many blocks to a negative or positive direction of each axis from the center of Hypersprawl the block is. 

In the center of the Hypersprawl is - for obvious pupular culture reasons, see book Snowcrash by Neal Stephenson - a large black tesseract called The Black Sun. 

The standard address format within the core hypersprawl containing 4 billion blocks is 8 hex characters, which is split to two characters for each axis. 

A simple example: address 01020304 is split to 01, 02, 03 and 04. The block is thus located 1 unit towards positive x axis, 2 units toward positive y axis, 3 units toward positive z axis and 4 units towards positive w axis. 

Note that the same location can be represented with a shorter hex string as well: 1234. Any shorter hex string can used as an address as well, you just convert the string to binary and split the binary to 4 equal length strings and assume two's complement signed binary for each part. 

Using this addressing scheme, hypersprawl can be split to different areas depending on how close to The Black Sun the block is, thus how short address can be used:

- Downtown, the closest blocks to The Black Sun with 2 character address (a bit less than 256 blocks)
- City, 3 character addresses, (about 4 000 blocks)
- Suburbs, 4 character addresses, (about 60 000 blocks)
- Countryside, 5-7 character addresses (about 270 million blocks)
- Outback, 8 Character addresses (about 4 billion blocks) 
- The Void, longer than 8 characters, currently supported up to 32 characters (in the order of 10^38 blocks)


Reserving your address and pricing
----------------------------------

For now, you can reserve one Outback address for free. Unfortunately we can not make guarantees that these addresses are going to be free forever, but you will get a notification at least 6 months in advance if there are going to be changes in pricing. However, they are going to be free as long as this project is otherwise economically feasible, so if you have the means, please consider upgrading your account and getting closer to The Black Sun.

If you want to have a block closer to The Black Sun, you need to make a subscription or payment at our buymeacoffee.com account:

- Countryside account: 2 EUR/month
- Suburbs: 4 EUR / month
- City: 16 EUR / month
- Downtown: 128 EUR / month

These addresses can be moved/sold to other owners as long as the subscription fee is paid. Once the payment fails, there is a 6 month grace period to resume subscription after which the ownership of the address moves back to Brainpaingames. The subscription prices for existing subscribers are planned to be fixed, but we keep right to increase them if EU CPI increases more than twofold from 2023 level. For new subscritions the price may be adjusted at any time. 


Once you have selected your pricing tier and created a subscription at buymeacoffee.com if applicable, go to webpage www.vvvvv.fi and enter your email address. You will receive an email with a link to a page you can use to manage your blocks in hypersprawl. 

If you have not reserved an address yet, you will be offered a form to enter an address you would like to reserve. To find available addresses, have a look at here.



Upload your 4d objects
----------------------

First, it is recommended that you experiment and review your objects in hypershack before uploading them. See tutorials. 

Go to webpage www.vvvvv.fi and enter your email address. You will receive an email with a link to a page you can use to manage your blocks in hypersprawl.

You will be offered a form you can use to upload the 4d objects to your block in hypersprawl.

There are some limitations on your 4d object on hypersprawl:

- max amount of objects is 20
- all coordinate values must be between 0.0 and 10.0
