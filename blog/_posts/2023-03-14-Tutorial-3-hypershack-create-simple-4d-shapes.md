title: "Hypershack - Create simple 4d shapes"

So far we have been looking around the same red 5cell. That becomes boring pretty fast, so this post explains how to create some other simple objects in the 4d space of hypershack. 

Before clicking start in hypershack, there is a input box for 4d object json. Replace the content of the box with the json strings given in the examples and click start to see the different objects. Feel free to tinker around with the json parameters to see how they affect the object.

Note that even if the examples in this post all contain only one object, the syntax for the json is a list of json objects. More complex objects will be built on later posts. 


3d Tetrahedron
==============
Let's start with not a four-dimensional object, but a three dimensional object. And maybe the simplest possible one, a tetrahedron that is specified by four points.

A three dimensional cross-section of a tetrhedron in 4d is a two dimensional triangle or a quadrilateral.
