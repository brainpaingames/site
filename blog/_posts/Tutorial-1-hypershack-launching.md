==============================

You can just go to [https://brainpaingames.github.io/hypershack](https://brainpaingames.github.io/Hypershack). There is a default 4d json for a small fivecell object on the screen.

If you want to simulate VR controllers on your browser without actually having those on hand, you can install add-on (link here)
